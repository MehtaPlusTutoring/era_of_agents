  "title": "Tabby Intern Remote Work Policy",
  "content": "Tabby believes in providing flexible work arrangements for our interns while ensuring they receive the necessary mentorship and guidance. Interns are required to be in-office 4 days per week for their first month to facilitate onboarding and relationship building. After the first month, interns may transition to a hybrid schedule with up to 2 remote days per week, though Tuesdays and Thursdays remain mandatory in-office days for all team members. Interns must be accessible during core hours (10am-3pm) regardless of location and attend all scheduled mentorship sessions. Remote workspaces must meet basic ergonomic requirements, and interns should ensure they have reliable internet connections when working remotely.",
