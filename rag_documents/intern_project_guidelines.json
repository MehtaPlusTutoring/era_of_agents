  "title": "Tabby Summer Intern Project Guidelines",
  "content": "Summer interns at Tabby participate in our 12-week Paws-on Experience Program, working on real projects that impact our cat matchmaking platform. Each intern is assigned to one of our core teams: Algorithm Development, User Experience, Data Analytics, or Mobile Development. During the first week, interns collaborate with their mentors to define a project proposal with clear deliverables. Mid-program presentations occur at week 6, with final presentations to the leadership team in week 12. Interns are expected to document their work thoroughly and prepare knowledge transfer materials. Outstanding projects may be implemented in our production environment. All intern code undergoes the same review process as full-time engineers, providing valuable feedback for growth. Interns who successfully complete their projects receive a Certificate of Feline Technology Excellence and may be considered for future employment opportunities.",
