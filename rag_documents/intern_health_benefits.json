  "content": "Tabby cares about the health and wellbeing of all our interns. Interns working more than 30 hours per week receive limited medical coverage, including preventative care and emergency services. All intern health services can be accessed through our partnership with PawPatrol Health Clinics. Interns are eligible for these benefits from day one of their internship program. Mental health support is available through our Kitten Counseling program, offering three free sessions per month. All interns have access to our on-site grooming station and quiet rooms for mid-day naps, which we highly encourage for optimal productivity.",
