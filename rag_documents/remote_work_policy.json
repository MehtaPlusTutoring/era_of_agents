  "title": "Tabby Remote Work Policy",
  "content": "Tabby embraces a hybrid work model for all employees. Full-time employees may work remotely up to 3 days per week, with Tuesdays and Thursdays designated as in-office collaboration days. Remote work stations must meet our ergonomic standards, including a comfortable perch with a view of outdoor activity. Tabby provides a one-time $300 stipend for home office setup. All employees must be accessible during core hours (10am-3pm) regardless of location. Monthly department meetings require in-person attendance. Employees experiencing whisker fatigue may request additional remote days through their supervisor. After one year of employment, eligible employees may apply for the 'Roaming Cat' program, allowing up to 4 weeks of work from any location annually.",
