  "title": "Tabby Cat Vacation Policy",
  "content": "At Tabby, we understand that our feline employees need time to recharge their batteries. Full-time employees receive 20 catnip days per year, which can be used for lounging in sunspots, bird watching, or other relaxing activities. These days accrue at 1.67 days per month. Unused catnip days roll over with a maximum cap of 30 days. All time off requests must be submitted through the Paw Portal at least two weeks in advance and approved by your direct supervisor. Emergency whisker appointments are exempt from the two-week notice requirement. Employees with more than 5 years of service receive an additional 5 catnip days annually in recognition of their loyalty to Tabby.",
