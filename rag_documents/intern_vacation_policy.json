  "title": "Tabby Intern Vacation Policy",
  "content": "Tabby understands that even interns need time to recharge their batteries. Interns receive 5 catnip days for a 3-month internship, prorated for shorter or longer terms. These days can be used for lounging in sunspots, bird watching, or other relaxing activities. Catnip days must be used during the internship period and do not roll over or pay out at the end of the program. All time off requests must be submitted through the Paw Portal at least one week in advance and approved by both your mentor and the internship coordinator. Interns are discouraged from taking time off during the first two weeks or final two weeks of their internship. Emergency whisker appointments are exempt from the one-week notice requirement with proper documentation.",
