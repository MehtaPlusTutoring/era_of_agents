  "content": "Tabby is committed to helping our interns develop the skills they need for successful careers in the cat matchmaking industry. Interns participate in a structured learning program that includes weekly 'Kitten Coding Sessions' focused on technical skill development. Each intern is paired with a senior developer who provides mentorship throughout the internship period. Interns have access to our internal knowledge base and are encouraged to complete at least one certification in our core technologies. A personal development plan is created at the start of the internship with specific learning goals. All interns attend our bi-weekly 'Tech Talk Tuesdays' where industry experts share insights and trends. Interns who show exceptional growth may be invited to present their learnings at our monthly all-hands meetings.",
